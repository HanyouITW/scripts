"""
# -V      Declares that all environment variables in the qsub command's environment are to be exported to the batch job.
# -I      Declares  that  the  job is to be run "interactively".  The job will be queued and scheduled as any PBS batch job, but when executed, the standard input, output,
               and error streams of the job are connected through qsub to the terminal session in which qsub is running.  Interactive jobs are forced to not rerunable.  See the
               "Extended Description" paragraph for addition information of interactive jobs.
# -A account_string
               Defines  the account string associated with the job.  The account_string is an undefined string of characters and is interpreted by the server which executes the
               job.  See section 2.7.1 of the PBS ERS.
# -q destination
               Defines the destination of the job.  The destination names a queue, a server, or a queue at a server.

               The  qsub  command will submit the script to the server defined by the destination argument.  If the destination is a routing queue, the job may be routed by the
               server to a new destination.

               If the -q option is not specified, the qsub command will submit the script to the default server.  See PBS_DEFAULT under the  Environment  Variables  section  on
               this man page and the PBS ERS section 2.7.4, "Default Server".

               If the -q option is specified, it is in one of the following three forms:
                   queue
                   @server
                   queue@server

               If the destination argument names a queue and does not name a server, the job will be submitted to the named queue at the default server.

               If the destination argument names a server and does not name a queue, the job will be submitted to the default queue at the named server.

               If the destination argument names both a queue and a server, the job will be submitted to the named queue at the named server.
# -l resource_list
               Defines  the resources that are required by the job and establishes a limit to the amount of resource that can be consumed.  If not set for a generally available
               resource, such as CPU time, the limit is infinite.  The resource_list argument is of the form:
                   resource_name[=[value]][,resource_name[=[value]],...]
